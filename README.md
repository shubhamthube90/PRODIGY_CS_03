# Password Complexity Checker

## Overview:

This project is a Python-based tool developed during my internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The tool assesses the strength of a password based on various criteria, providing users with feedback on the password's strength.

### Features:

*1. Password Length*
* Description: Checks if the password meets the defined length criteria.
* Criteria: Password must be at least 8 characters long.
  
*2. Presence of Uppercase Letters*
* Description: Verifies if the password contains uppercase letters.
* Criteria: At least one uppercase letter (A-Z) must be present.
  
*3. Presence of Lowercase Letters*
* Description: Verifies if the password contains lowercase letters.
* Criteria: At least one lowercase letter (a-z) must be present.
  
*4. Presence of Numbers*
* Description: Checks if the password includes numbers.
* Criteria: At least one digit (0-9) must be present.
  
*5. Presence of Special Characters*
* Description: Checks if the password includes special characters.
* Criteria: At least one special character from the set @$!%*?& must be present.
  
### Output:

The tool evaluates the password based on the above criteria and generates a score. The strength of the password is displayed based on the score:

* 5: Very Strong
  
* 4: Strong

* 3: Medium

* 2: Weak

* <2: Very Weak# PRODIGY_CS_03
